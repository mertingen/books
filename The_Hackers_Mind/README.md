## The Hacker's Mind - Tamer Åžahin

I've read it twice and this book is really fastmoving. Each 3-4 pages consists an anectode from Tamer's life. He is first trial hacker in Turkey. It seems, as Tamer said, he has got big ego in a positive way because he exploits this situation very well. As I said, there are some anectodes and shory stories from his like a pill to read. Like you are being a witness to each story. Like climbing a stairs, you observe his career failes or achievements.

Also, you will be able to get information 80s, 90s IT and hacker's lives. This was so attractive for me. When I finihed to read the book, I watched the videos on internet regarding attenting talk-shows and programs on TV. I was having fun because you imagine the incidents in his life while you're watching. It was different experience. 

I think, it needs a lot of courage what he has done during his life. I certainly recommend this book to get new perspectives and principles. There might be for businiess life or prive life. In addition to this, I'd love to suggest to read a part about the war between Sony and Anonymous. Score table was a barrel of laughs.
