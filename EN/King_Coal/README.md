## King Coal - Upton Sinclair

I like novels that revolve around class struggle. This book takes us to the coal mine in the mountainous region of Colorado in the early 1900s. Hal, the son of a wealthy mine owner himself, takes a job at the mine as a miner's apprentice by disguising himself. But when he gets a job, he makes a heady introduction to the miners' living conditions, problems, and life struggles and finds herself as a pioneer of a strike. He meets many people in the quarry. Among them, the improvement of the beautiful Irish, red-haired Mary was also remarkable. The miners' ownership of their troubles, class conflict and awareness, Mary's beautiful and strong heart, the struggle they gave was very beautiful. In addition, many of the characters are immigrants from other countries and there is a level of respect among themselves according to their nationality. In the book, the cruelty of the bosses, how capitalism oppresses people. We see the self-interestedness of the unions in all its simplicity. I liked the work very much. The author has a very plain and clear language.

To write this novel, which has been likened to Zola's Germinal, Upton Sinclair made observations several times in the Colorado coal mines in 1913-14. First published in 1917, The Coal King is based on a wave of great strikes that actually took place in the same years and were suppressed by military force.
