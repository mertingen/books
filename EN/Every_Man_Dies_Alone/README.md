## Every Man Dies Alone - Hans Fallada ##

So far we have seen Hitler's Germany through the eyes of the Jews and their suffering, and this novel shows how the Germans were under pressure and suffered at that time, I recommend those who want to see a different perspective. In the novel, the hatred, and even the most important of all, neighbors, friends, relatives, and even husbands fed into the crisis, oppression, poverty, injustice, unlawfulness, injustice, and perhaps most importantly, of the German people, rather than the Jewish massacres that took place outside the familiar patterns. and a different point of view was put forward by drawing attention to the problem of trust.

This book argues that anyone who is oppressed by bullying schemes must do everything they can to protect freedom and human rights as a moral imperative. On the other hand, it shows how the masses, fascinated by the promises of utopian absolutism, accept and support the domination of terrorism and thus lose their human emotions.

The story tells Otto Quangel commutes to his job at the factory, and Anna Quangel continues her work in the women's arm of the Nazi Party. One day, a spark sparks in their brains when their sons on the front receive news of death. They realize that, even if only two, they must challenge this brutal fascism. So they find themselves in the middle of a chase that includes Gestapo officers, pro-Hitler neighbors, family friends, and many more Berliners.

I wouldn't rather tell the whole story but I drastically recommend reading this book in your life. You won't regret it.
