## Just for Fun - Linus Torwalds

Linus Torvalds was one of those annoying tech-obsessions who had been stalled with computers since childhood, known in a narrow band in Helsinki. He then wrote a pioneering operating system and distributed it free of charge via the Internet. Torvalds is an international folk hero today. And created by him, LINUX is used by over 12 million people as well as companies like IBM.
Now, while Torvalds presents the history of its software that causes people to change beliefs with e-mail speed, it also sincerely reveals the quick wit of a genius. The result: the entertaining story of a man who challenges our values and has a revolutionary vision that can change our world.

This book tells the life story of Linus Torvalds, followed by Open Source, the future of Linux and its technological interpretations, this book is very fluid.

The most fascinating place for me in this book is the excitement he experienced when he was slowly starting to announce Linux from his e-mail group and his e-mail conversation with the creator of Minix (I couldn't remember his name). In addition, I am also pleased that he expresses in his book that he was very impressed by Richard Stallman.
