## The Tartar Steppe - Dino Buzzati ##

"When someone suffers, his pain is his own, no one can alleviate that pain a little; he realized that when a person suffers, others do not suffer, no matter how great their love is, and that this is how the loneliness in life is."

I adored this paragraph from this book.

Tatar desert is a kind of southeast border. If the greatest danger will come one day, it will come from there. That's why nobody wants to go even if they go. After a while, he wants to return immediately, saying, "What a meaningless place, the enemy will not come alive." The only reason they want to go to the border of the Tatar desert is that the military service done there is calculated twice as normal. As such, one day the king decides to reduce the number of soldiers, believing that the border of the Tatar desert is actually not that important and that there will be no enemies from there. Whoever wants to can now return. The vicious cycle starts here. for some reason nobody wants to return anymore...

The shocking story that advises that life can only be lived once, therefore it is necessary to make the most of a lifetime. message from the book: don't forget to live the real life with absurd fear or dreams. Make use of the big little chances that come your way. It made me think that after reading it, I should move away from every environment I am in and do something different and start a new life; It is a masterpiece that makes me want to get away from my school, family, friends, my country and even the world.
