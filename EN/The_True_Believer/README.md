## The True Believer - Eric Hoffer

It is a lively work whose content will never become obsolete. I want to state that I enjoyed reading it very much. The author tried to explain the mass, which he called strict believers, through historical events, revolutions, and certain human communities. From the birth of Christianity to the spread of Islam, from the Nazi genocide to the October revolution of the Bolsheviks, from the Far East movements to the declaration of human rights in the USA; He touched on a number of historical events that you can think of. And in connection with this, from Hitler to Stalin, from Ghandi to Lenin, from Atat√ºrk to Lincoln, the leaders who led the mass movements.

Eric Hoffer has observed many mass movements and their leaders. In True Believers, we witness the development of Hoffer's observation skills. Hoffer's book deals with the common features of all mass movements and the impact of mass movements on society, rather than dealing with mass movements one by one. The point that the book emphasizes most is the factors in an individual's involvement in a mass movement. Many clues about how mass movements affect the individual are contained in the book True Believers. In addition, the book deals with how the frustrated person, the rich-poor person, the individual with strong or weak family ties, minorities, the poor and sinners approach mass movements one by one. The book also covers how an individual can join a mass movement by feeling their needs.
