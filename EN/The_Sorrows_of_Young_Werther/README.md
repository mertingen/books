## The Sorrows of Young Werther - Goethe

Goethe, one of the leading figures of German literature, was only 25 years old when he wrote The Sorrows of Young Werther. The novel consists of letters written by the main character Werther to his close friend Wilhelm. A young legal intern named Werther falls in love with a woman named Lotte. This love is full of suffering and pain, at the same time surrounded by impossibilities and obstacles. Because Lotte is an engaged woman and social rules do not allow Werther and Lotte to unite.

Right after the book was published, it was banned for a long time in Germany, as it drove young lovers to commit suicide. In fact, the readers of the book in Germany at that time were so impressed with the book that the fashion for "dressing like Werther", the main character in the book, started. Young people wearing blue jackets and yellow trousers surrounded the scene. This is really nice information. Think about how a book can change a person's attire... This is such an impressive piece of work. You will want to underline every sentence while reading this work, which is full of wonderful descriptions together with the power of observation of Goethe's being a painter; It is truly one of the world's classics.
