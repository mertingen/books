## Gulliver's Travels - Grigory Petrov

It is a Jonathan Swift classic that appeals to children with its complex and deep political meanings and images with its different characters. Originally written in satirical style, it was written to criticize the politics of 18th century England, and especially the Whig party.

The name of the protagonist Gulliver is derived from the word 'gullible' which means 'pure'. The human mission, who has experienced everything and is not aware of malevolent people, has been attributed to Swift.
The road first falls to the land of the dwarves called Lilliput, which lilliputan represents England and Blefuscu represents France. Swift makes fun of the discussions arising from the tiny sectarian differences between them, and emphasizes how insignificant the discussions actually emerge from. The small size of Lilliputans is in line with the moral dimension of the Whig batch.

Gulliver's road later falls to the land of the gigantic people called Brobdingnag, and since he remains like a dwarf, these people will become their mascara and fun for a while. Then it falls to the island ofLlaputa, then to the island of wise horses called Houyhynhynm. Using almost all of the characters symbolically, Jonathan Swift criticizes politics, economy, religion and even society for his lack of knowledge on some subjects and for thinking that he cannot see the real faces of politicians in this classic work.
