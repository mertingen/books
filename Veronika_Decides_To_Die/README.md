## Veronika Decides to Die - Paulo Coelho ##

One of the great books written by Paulo Coelho. It is a book that can be easily completed because it is written in a very plain language and has an engaging subject.

In fact, every human being is crazy in essence but the number of those who reveal it is really few, that a poison called vitriol drags the person into depression by building walls inside, that what is ridiculous to someone else means to someone else and that is why it is stigmatized as crazy by the society, whereas even a tie Although it has an unnecessary function, it gives people status and dignity as a society, but when you consider this from a madman, one decides how absurd it is. Most people act according to community norms to avoid being truly stigmatized. He couldn't even imagine what kind of person he was, because his own mind would brand him as crazy. This book made me feel that mental hospitals are actually surrounded by free people and those who find their true selves live there.

It should definitely be read by those who think how unworthy and empty life is, it should be bound and reviewed over and over again after its summary is taken. The book that caused me to review the world we live in and all the tags and all the adjectives we attach to people while reading. It's only a matter of time before you can find yourself in any character.

I think the novel that begins with the question "why does a person commit suicide" and ends with "why shouldn't one commit suicide".
