## Once There Was a War - John Steinbeck

In this book, I was waiting for incidents and scenes of the Second of The World but it surprised me. Because, it demonstrates feeling and thoughts of ordinary soldiers in the background of the war. John Steinbeck participated the war as a reporter. In fact, the USA wanted to make their propoganda in this wise. He was a very good observer. Therefore, he was able to show us all of stuff with all its nudity. He approaches events as a sensitive and sincere writer in the face of human suffering. There was a war that never lost its meaning and value in our world.

Actually, John Steinbeck wanted to work as a spy at the intelligence of the USA. Yet, the goverment has seen him as a communist because of his earlier labor and books. In this way, he could find ways to visit to Algeria, Sicily, southern Italy and northern Africa as a part of the army.
He gathered investigations by taking notes and publishing the book.

A documentary-like novel. He explains all the details in the war so well without jumping that you are living the war. From the destroyers to the uniformed goat, from the pink pajamas man, from the rabbit feet, to the coins, the psychology of the soldiers, the way they behave, whatever life is going on in the war. A book so full. The author has described in detail how bad war is, how it affects people's lives and health, and more. It is an important book and I can say that I have read it without getting bored anywhere. 

As a matter of fact, **Steinbeck's books are read always.**
