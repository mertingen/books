## In Dubious Battle - John Steinbeck

Obviously, I can say that this is my favorite book ever. When I found some people who have the same mindset as me, I feel awesome and delighted. Because you assume that you are not alone. I mention Mac and Jim Nolan character in this book. They are more radical than me. That's why I adore them.

The book pictures workers and their labors in the USA in 1920-1935. There is a valley and this valley consists of apple trees. The land belongs to a few rich guys. These guys exploit the workers fatally. As always there will be radicals to be against them. Mac and Jim start a struck for them and John Steinbeck pictures their dubious battle very well. You will be a witness to each of the incidents surprisingly. I drastically suggest it and I'd like to talk on a movie of the book. It filmed in 2016 from James Franco. I watched it and it shows every paragraph pleasing to the eye.

I guarantee that once you finished this book, you won't regret it.
As a matter of fact, **Steinbeck's books are read always.**
