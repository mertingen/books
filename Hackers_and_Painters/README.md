## Hackers And Painters - Paul Graham

Paul graham's book, which sells "Viaweb" to Yahoo for $ 49 million, analyzes the world and how to make money. The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more. A collection of essays that are thought-provoking and insightful. The author makes nerds look super cool, so a big thumbs up from me. I recommend it to programmers and people interested in computer science. Will reread and write a proper review sometime in the future.

A fun-to-read mix of insight and ideology, Graham is someone we can learn from no matter which side of the box he's thinking on. His essay on nerds ("Why Nerds are Unpopular") is still a favorite, even while his essay on disparity of wealth ("Mind the Gap") is among the most unreflective apologies for anarcho-capitalism I've ever read.

"In any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. Iâ€™ve noticed that this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks."
