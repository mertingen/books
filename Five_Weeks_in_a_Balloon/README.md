## Five Weeks in a Balloon - Jules Verne

Doctor Fergusson and his two friends embark on a dangerous journey in a balloon, yes just a balloon, to realize the African voyage that no one else has succeeded. Of course, this idea belongs to Doctor Fergusson, our cool and rational hero thinks through every detail. When his assistant Joe has the excitement and chatter that he does not have, there is no reason not to go on this journey, but the doctor's Scottish friend Dick is a little worried, even what he does to prevent it, but finds himself on this journey. This trip of the three friends creates a great impact. Because this trip will be by balloon! Not by train, not by ship, not by carriage, but by a balloon!

The African continent has always been in a different place for Europeans and although they tried every way to explore it, they missed most of what happened to them. Here, Fergusson's aim is to explore these overlooked and unreachable places to the fullest and to have his name written in important places. He has traveled the world, but Africa is still mysterious to him. Traveling by balloon is a way he finds to avoid dangers… But be ready for an exciting adventure where you have to hold on tight while reading, as the danger will always be at the door and on the back of their neck!

The details of the author's scientific explanations and the laws of physics were also astonishing. Europe got to where it is today thanks to what the people living there took from them. Gold, furs, ivory… Mankind is ungrateful. Still, I liked the book because it would be a little unfair to treat it from one side. I read a wonderful novel that combines master writer Jules Verne's extraordinary imagination and successful narration: Five Weeks in a Balloon. It is also the author's first novel, a travel diary. The fact that it was written at a time when flying with a cloth balloon was not yet widespread is just one of the aspects that make this novel unique. Even if you find it difficult to read at first because it is a novel that highlights scientific data, you can be sure that it will flow like water later on. The many dangerous adventures of the three friends during the journey will make you sit and get up, so to speak. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys fiction blending adventure and science.
