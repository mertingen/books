## The Library of Alexandria - Roy Macleod

It is the most important symbol of the war of ignorance against knowledge. it also shows how powerful a tool religions are in using the masses. Unfortunately, along with hypatia and theon, it is a temple that is the tomb of very valuable information and irreplaceable legacies about human history, philosophy and science. The science-culture center, which has become the center of the world in philosophy, geometry, mathematics, theology, astronomy, physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and many fields, has dragged humanity into an almost impossible darkness with the destruction of religious tyranny. The biggest lesson to be learned from the loss after this disaster is ignorance and the fact that religion is the greatest curse of humanity.

Philosophy comes etymologically from the words philo-sophia. namely the love of knowledge. Those who destroyed this place were totally against it. Moreover, not content with this, the greatest philosopher and scientists of the period did not hesitate to murder Hypatia and her father Theon. The most important phrase uttered many, many years after that was "religion is the opium of societies". Think about it, after nearly two thousand years, we were able to access only a scrap of information in Alexandria! how sad.
