## The Subterraneans - Jack Kerouac ##

It is a poetic novel by Jack Kerouac. My advice to new readers is to read it from the very beginning to the end without a break. Thus the effect will be more as the emotion from the book to the reader is not interrupted.

After reading this novel which introduces us to the San Francisco beat generation of the 1950s, by making us live almost step by step the love story of a couple of the time, we are immediately familiar. Because his writing is one of speech, of choppy sentences, of reflection on the spot throughout a novel which is only after the fact, only once we think about it again because at the first reading we are caught in the whirlwind of this jerky, hatched writing. He says it himself at the very end of the book: "And I go home having lost his love. Writing this book." Frankly striking because we are witnessing the birth of a generation like Percepied, the main character, the one who tells this book. 

There are so many facts you can find in this book I know of the classic love story. It's a story that you want to write about alcohol, love, and at what cost. The author's descriptions are simple to readers, but Jack Kerouac, one of the founders of the beat generation, knows which words will catch the reader. After I finished the book, I was only able to say "Never trust an addict".
